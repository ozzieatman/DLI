# DLI
Test for DLI


You may clone the entire repository and run the script as follows.

localhost:8000/test/50

Where 50 may be any integer value that specifies the list size. 

The script will then calculate the total and return as an HTTP Response.

Alternatively, if unable to run the Django file you may use the inidivual script.py file and run
that on the command line:

python3 script.py.

This will run the script, giving a solution to the problem. However the list size is hard coded in. You may change the list size
directly in script.py.
